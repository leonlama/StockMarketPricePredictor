# StockMarketPricePredictor

# Introduction
This programs aim is to predict the stock market price of a company using a simple neural network with 3 layers (in this program a sequential model is used).
The neural network trains with the data provided by a finance api (e.g. Yahoo) and will then predict what the price of a stock will be on the following day.
It is important that this is not any financial advise, I do not recommend trading based on the information you get from that program. It is for educational
purpose only!

# Technologies
The program is written in Python 3.6. Some packages need to be installed in order to run the program.

Packages: - numpy
          - matplot
          - pandas
          - datetime
          - tensorflow
          
# Launch
In order to run the programm you simply run the main.py file (provided in the folder) in your prefered IDE or in your Terminal.
The program doesn´t need any specific requirements and yous should be able to run it easily on your PC / Laptop /...

# Additional Information
You can easily modify the neural network and change the layers or the amout of days based on which the nn starts it´s training in order to achieve more 
accurate results. The nn is not optimized! So feel free to experiment with the data.
